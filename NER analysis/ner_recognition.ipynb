until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to sheep .\",\"Germany 's representative to the European Union 's veterinary committee Werner Zwingmann said on Wednesday consumers should buy sheepmeat from countries other than Britain until the scientific advice was clearer .\",\"\\\" We do n't support any such recommendation because we do n't see any grounds for it , \\\" the Commission 's chief spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas told a news briefing .\",\"He said further scientific study was required and if it was found that action was needed it should be taken by the European Union .\",\"He said a proposal last month by EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler to ban sheep brains , spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains was a highly specific and precautionary move to protect human health .\",\"Fischler proposed EU-wide measures after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ( BSE ) -- mad cow disease .\",\"But Fischler agreed to review his proposal after the EU 's standing veterinary committee , mational animal health officials , questioned if such action was justified as there was only a slight risk to human health .\",\"Spanish Farm Minister Loyola de Palacio had earlier accused Fischler at an EU farm ministers ' meeting of causing unjustified alarm through \\\" dangerous generalisation . \\\"\",\".\",\"Only France and Britain backed Fischler 's proposal .\",\"The EU 's scientific veterinary and multidisciplinary committees are due to re-examine the issue early next month and make recommendations to the senior veterinary officials .\",\"Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie , a brain-wasting disease similar to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste .\",\"British farmers denied on Thursday there was any danger to human health from their sheep , but expressed concern that German government advice to consumers to avoid British lamb might influence consumers across Europe .\",\"\\\" What we have to be extremely careful of is how other countries are going to take Germany 's lead , \\\" Welsh National Farmers ' Union ( NFU ) chairman John Lloyd Jones said on BBC radio .\",\"Bonn has led efforts to protect public health after consumer confidence collapsed in March after a British report suggested humans could contract an illness similar to mad cow disease by eating contaminated beef .\",\"Germany imported 47,600 sheep from Britain last year , nearly half of total

court sentenced U.S. neo-Nazi leader Gary Lauck on Thursday to four years in prison for pumping banned extremist propaganda into Germany from his base in the United States .\",\"Lauck , from Lincoln , Nebraska , yelled a tirade of abuse at the court after his conviction for inciting racial hatred .\",\"\\\" The struggle will go on , \\\" the 43-year-old shouted in German before being escorted out by security guards .\",\"Lauck 's lawyer vowed he would appeal against the court 's decision , arguing that his client should have been set free because he had not committed any offence under German law .\",\"The German government hailed the conviction as a major victory in the fight against neo-Nazism .\",\"Lauck 's worldwide network has been the main source of anti-Semitic propaganda material flowing into Germany since the 1970s .\",\"\\\" Lauck possessed a well-oiled propaganda machine , honed during more than 20 years , \\\" presiding judge Guenter Bertram told the court .\",\"\\\" He set up a propaganda cannon and fired it at Germany . \\\"\",\"said Bertram , who also read out extracts from Lauck 's material praising Hitler as \\\" the greatest of all leaders \\\" and describing the Nazi slaughter of millions of Jews as a myth .\",\"Eager to put Lauck behind bars quickly and avoid a long and complex trial , prosecutor Bernd Mauruschat limited his charges to offences since 1994 .\",\"He had demanded a five-year jail term but said he was satisfied with the court 's sentence .\",\"Publishing and distributing neo-Nazi material is illegal in Germany but Lauck 's defence

incomprehensible quick-fire diatribe against the court .\",\"\\\" Neither the National Socialists ( Nazis ) nor the communists dared to kidnap an American citizen , \\\" he shouted , in an oblique reference to his extradition to Germany from Denmark . \\\"\",\"That 's the truth . \\\"\",\"His attorney , Hans-Otto Sieg , told reporters outside the courtroom that the judges had not explained how a German court could judge someone for actions carried out in the United States .\",\"Bertram said Lauck was obsessed by Nazism and devoted his life to leading his National Socialist German Workers ' Party Foreign Organisation ( NSDAP-AO ) , which derives its name from the full German title of Hitler 's Nazi party .\",\"During the three-month trial , the court dealt mainly with issues of the NSDAP-AO 's \\\" NS Kampfruf \\\" ( \\\" National Socialist Battle Cry \\\" ) magazine , filled with references to Aryan supremacy and defamatory statements about Jews .\",\"The court rejected Sieg 's argument that Lauck 's extradition from Denmark , where he was arrested in March last year at the request of German authorities , was illegal .\",\"Lauck was also convicted of disseminating the symbols of anti-constitutional organisations .\",\"He will probably be free in around two and a half years .\",\"The court ruled that the 15 months he has spent in custody since his arrest should be

interest rate cuts , of 18.50 for September , 20.00 for December , 22.00 for March and 23.5 for June , he said .\",\"At 1347 GMT , December Euromark futures were trading at 96.78 , two basis points down on the day .\",\"He said the sell-off in June vols might have been overdone , which could offer value at current levels .\",\"He said caps and floors would be well bid after the round of interest rate cuts due to the fact these rates should stay low at the short end .\",\"The size of the Bundesbank 's repo rate cut , to 3.00 percent from 3.30 percent , took markets by surprise .\",\"\\\" Volatility has a bid to it -- longer-dated volatility more than short-dated because the event people were buying for has passed and now perhaps people will sell some short dated vol and buy some long

publicized introduction , Microsoft Corp. 's Windows 95 computer operating system has fallen short of the most optimistic expectations for the software giant and the industry .\",\"Even though more than 40 million copies of Windows 95 have been sold , making it the fastest-selling new software ever , it would have been impossible for any product to live up to the unprecedented hype of the Aug. 24 , 1995 launch , when stores around the world opened at midnight to greet long lines of customers .\",\"The Redmond , Wash.-based company spent tens of millions of dollars promoting the product with stunts that included buying the entire print run of the Times of London and lighting New York 's Empire State building in a Windows color scheme .\",\"But the product , delivered eight months late , has fallen short of its sales potential in part because Microsoft delivered a mixed message to business customers , analysts said .\",\"\\\" It did n't do as well as it could have , \\\" said Rob Enderle , an analyst with Giga Information Group .\",\"Scores of software and hardware companies that had hoped for a big boost in sales were disappointed when only a brief spike materialized .\",\"\\\" People who were expecting major coat-tails were somewhat disappointed , \\\" said Scott Winkler , an analyst with Gartner Group .\",\"\\\" It 's not as though it has n't had an impact , \\\" he said . \\\"\",\"It just has n't had the huge earth-shattering impact some people were looking for . \\\"\",\"Symantec Corp. , which had been among the most bullish of software companies at the time of the Windows 95 launch , ended up posting disappointing financial results when retail sales of the operating system fell short of its projections .\",\"Touchstone Software Corp. had to pay $ 1.3 million in cash and stock to settle a shareholders lawsuit brought after the company 's sales failed to meet expectations tied to the Windows 95 launch .\",\"Many software developers apparently saw their crucial holiday season sales suffer last year because store shelves were jammed with blue-and-white boxes of Windows 95 , resulting in a shortage of space for seasonal products , said Ann Stephens , president of PC Data Inc .\",\"To be sure , sales of Windows 95 and the accompanying Office 95 upgrade drove Microsoft sales up 46 percent last year to a record $ 8.67 billion and cemented the company 's status as the industry 's dominant company .\",\"Microsoft executives say they are thrilled with the sales figures , and industry analysts estimate that by sometime next year , the installed base of Windows 95 will surpass that of the older version of Windows , now used on about 100 million computers worldwide .\",\"But Enderle said the figure could have been even higher if Microsoft had done a better job of handling the huge demand for technical support from customers who were frustrated trying to install the system .\",\"He and other analysts said corporate America adopted a go-slow approach because Microsoft already was promoting the new version of its high-end Windows NT operating system , expected to be available in stores in the next several weeks .\",\"\\\" Microsoft sent a lot of signals that NT was going to be the answer , \\\" Winkler said . \\\"\",\"Many people began to believe that Windows 95 was being downplayed . \\\"\",\"But now that Windows NT 4.0 has been launched , Winkler and others believe only a relatively small proportion of corporate users will elect to pay the added software and hardware costs needed to use it instead of Windows 95 .\",\"\\\" Windows 95 is going to do great , \\\" he said . \\\"\",\"The mistake people made was in thinking it was going to be a fast , sweeping change rather than a slow , building change . \\\"\",\"U.S. says still committed to

on crime .\",\"\\\" Sixty days ago I directed the attorney general to draw up a plan for a national registry of sex offenders , \\\" Clinton said . \\\"\",\"That plan has now reached my desk . \\\"\",\"\\\" Today I am pleased to announce that we are following through on our commitment to keep track of these criminals , not just in a single state but wherever they go , \\\" he said .\",\"Actually , creation of such a registry was underway without Clinton lifting a finger .\",\"Attorney General Janet Reno 's report -- all nine pages of it , including footnotes -- offers only the interim services of the FBI until a formal registry on sex offenders has been established .\",\"Two months ago , Clinton announced he wanted an interim effort established .\",\"Now , 60 days later , he had a chance to talk about it again .\",\"It is an example of Clinton 's strategic planning as he heads into the stretch drive for the Nov. 5 presidential election .\",\"Such things do not happen by chance in the Clinton White House , they are part of his political chess game .\",\"In the past week Clinton signed into law an increase in the minimium wage , a bill that makes it easier for someone with a pre-existing health problem to change jobs , and sweeping changes overhauling the nation 's welfare system .\",\"\\\" America can look back on a week of remarkable achievement , \\\" Clinton said , without even a passing reference to the Republican majority in the House and Senate .\",\"\\\" America is on the right track offering more opportunity , demanding more responsibility , building a stronger community , the sense of shared values and stronger families , \\\" he said in striking the theme of his coming week .\",\"According to a senior campaign official , Clinton \\\" will be making a lot of news in the coming week -- something different each day . \\\"\",\"Clinton departs on Sunday on a four-day train trip through West Virginia , Kentucky , Ohio , Michigan and Indiana while fellow Democrats are gathered in Chicago .\",\"\\\" He 'll make news during the day ... and then at night the attention will go to the convention , \\\" said the campaign official . \\\"\",\"We think it 'll work really well . \\\"\",\"Although officials decline to say just what each day 's \\\" news \\\" will be , the intent is to put a focus on Clinton himself and not just those attending the party 's convention .\",\"Each day of the trip will have a late start , so that network television correspondents will be able to do live reports for morning programmes .\",\"Campaign officials then hope the day 's \\\" news \\\" event will be showcased on evening television news shows as a lead-in for that night 's convention programme .\",\"\\\" We 'll be concentrating ... on supporting the president as he is on the trip and making significant public policy statements related to some of his plans for the future , \\\" said White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry .\",\"McCurry said that when Clinton delivers his acceptance address on Thursday night to fellow Democrats and a national television audience , he will \\\" set out a road map \\\" for the nation 's future -- one the president hopes guides him back to the White House for four more years .\",\"Hurricane expected to veer north of Caribbean .\",\"MIAMI 1996-08-24\",\"Hurricane Edouard grew stronger on Saturday as it swirled across the Atlantic Ocean , but forecasters at the National Hurricane Center said the storm would likely swing north and miss the Caribbean .\",\"\\\" Edouard is getting stronger and stronger , and it already has winds of 105 mph ( 185 kph ) , \\\" said hurricane forecaster Lixion Avila .\",\"\\\" But the good news is that all our computer models indicate Edouard is going to turn to the west-northwest on Sunday and miss the islands , \\\" he added .\",\"At 11 a.m. EDT ( 1500 GMT ) , Edouard was 1,130 miles east of the Lesser Antilles and moving west at 14 mph ( 25 kph ) .\",\"Its exact position was latitude 14.5 north , longitude 44.2 west .\",\"France hands suspected ETA member to Spain .\",\"PARIS 1996-08-24\",\"France on Saturday handed a suspected member of the Basque separatist group ETA to Spanish authorities , French Interior Ministry officials said .\",\"Ignacio Olascoaga Mugica , who had just ended a prison sentence in France , is suspected of having taken part in several guerrilla attacks in Spain .\",\"ETA ( Basque Homeland and Freedom ) has killed about 800 people in its campaign for an independent Basque state since the 1960s .\",\"German troops to remain in Bosnia for 1997--Ruehe .\",\"BONN 1996-08-24\",\"Defence Minister Volker Ruehe said that German troops would stay on in Bosnia next year as part of an international force to ensure the establishment of peace , a newspaper reported on Saturday .\",\"The current NATO-led peace force ( IFOR ) in Bosnia is due to return home at the end of the year .\",\"But Ruehe told Bild am Sonntag in an interview that a \\\" new and different mandate \\\" for the troops would be agreed on for next year after the current mandate expires in December .\",\"\\\" After the ( Bosnian ) elections ( on September 14 ) the troops will start being reduced from the beginning of October from 60,000 to about 20,000 .\",\"A completely new and different mandate will be agreed for next year , \\\" Ruehe said .\",\"\\\" The defence ministers will begin negotiations for this at the beginning of September at a NATO meeting , \\\" he told the newspaper in an interview , excerpts of which were released ahead of publication on Sunday .\",\"\\\" But we must avoid giving the impression this peace deployment in former Yugoslavia is being perceived in the long run as an occupation .\",\"On the other hand we must prevent any return of war and massacres \\\" he said .\",\"Italian comics hope independence-joke 's on Bossi .\",\"ORVIETO , Italy 1996-08-24\",\"A group of Italian comics hope the joke will be on separatist leader Umberto Bossi next month when they lead the ancient Etruscan town of Orvieto in a mock split from Rome .\",\"Orvieto mayor Stefano Cimicchi said the comics , including popular actor Roberto Benigni , would declare Orvieto \\\" capital of Etruria \\\" on September 15 -- the day Bossi plans a march across the north in favour of independence from Rome .\",\"\\\" We will then proceed with the annexation of Sardinia , Corsica and Cyprus , \\\" Cimicchi told reporters on Saturday .\",\"He said the city council would be \\\" ironically present \\\" when the comics made their proclamation on the same day Bossi has threatened to declare the birth of Padania , the name he has given to northern Italy .\",\"Orvieto , located in Umbria between Rome and Florence , was once the capital of Etruria , an ancient federation of 12 Etruscan towns .\",\"\\\" We want to pop some air out of this balloon of tension that has been blown up around September 15 , \\\" Cimicchi said .\",\"\\\" We want to help turn down the rhetoric in a country that borders former Yugoslavia yet in which people are still talking about secession , \\\" he added .\",\"Bossi has intensified his separatist rhetoric since his Northern League party 's good showing in last April 's general election , when it took 10 percent of the vote nationally .\",\"He has recently dropped a drive for federalism , saying secession from Rome 's wasteful and centralised bureaucracy is the only solution for northerners .\",\"Italian farmer says he mutilated four women .\",\"VERONA , Italy 1996-08-24\",\"An Italian farmer accused of multiple homocide has confessed to mutilating the bodies of four women after having sex with them , the Italian news agency ANSA reported on Saturday .\",\"It quoted the lawyer of Gianfranco Stevanin as saying the 35-year-old farmer confessed on Friday to a Verona magistrate that he had killed and mutilated the women .\",\"ANSA said Stevanin was unable to recall how he had killed the women , remembering only that he had found them \\\" lifeless in his arms \\\" after having sadmasochistic sex with them .\",\"Stevanin , arrested in 1994 and jailed for three years for assaulting an Austrian prostitute , is accused of murdering five women , three of whose bodies were found near his villa outside Verona between July and December 1995 .\",\"Two of the corpses were identified but not the third , found headless and decomposed in a sack in a nearby canal .\",\"Lawyer Cesare dal Maso told ANSA that Stevanin confessed to beheading and dumping the body of a fourth woman in the nearby Adige river .\",\"Dal Maso declined to comment on the alleged fifth murder , saying only that \\\" the interrogations are not over yet \\\" with investigators .\",\"It said investigators believed Stevanin had suffocated them by putting plastic bags on their heads .\",\"Stevanin was first sentenced for assault but investigators began digging in the garden of his villa after the first body was found by a passer-by .\",\"Belgium asks how paedophile suspect eluded police .\",\"Jeremy Lovell\",\"BRUSSELS 1996-08-24\",\"Belgian police searched two more houses on Saturday for bodies in a child-sex scandal of murder , kidnapping and pornography that has sent a shockwave of revulsion throughout Europe .\",\"Recriminations built up over how the scandal 's central figure , convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux , managed to prey on children unhindered for so long .\",\"In just over a week two young girls have been found dead , from starvation , two have been freed from a dungeon-like secret compartment and an international hunt has started for at least two others .\",\"On Saturday investigators with dogs trained to find bodies searched one house at Ransart and one at Mont-sur-Marchienne -- both suburbs of the southern city of Charleroi .\",\"Both houses are owned by Dutroux .\",\"Belgian media speculated that Dutroux , charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children , must have had high level protection to molest youngsters .\",\"They put forward no proof to support the speculation , but seized on a comment by chief prosecutor Michel Bourlet on Belgian television on Friday night that he would chase down everyone involved in the case \\\" if I am allowed to \\\" .\",\"Bourlet said between 300 and 400 paedophile porn video tapes had been seized , some of which featured Dutroux .\",\"Dutroux was charged a week ago after police rescued two young girls from a concrete dungeon in the basement of one of the six houses he owns in and around Charleroi .\",\"Just a day later the national euphoria at the rescue turned to disgust as Dutroux led police to the bodies of two eight-year-old girls in another of his houses .\",\"Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo , had been kidnapped in June last year .\",\"Dutroux said they starved to death nine months later .\",\"He also admitted kidnapping two other girls , An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks , a year ago .\",\"The fate of the girls is unknown , but there has been speculation they were sold into prostitution in Slovakia or the Czech Republic where Dutroux was a frequent visitor .\",\"Belgian police have visited Bratislava and will visit Prague .\",\"Five other people have been arrested including Dutroux 's second wife Michelle Martin , charged as an accomplice .\",\"The others have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children or are suspected of criminal association .\",\"Dutch police are also holding a 74-year old Dutchman in connection with the disappearance of An and Eefje , although a spokesman said no direct link had yet been established .\",\"At least part of the speculation in the Belgian media of high-level protection for Dutroux and his accomplices is based on leaked documents cataloguing a high degree of police bungling , incompetence and indifference .\",\"Among the revelations are the fact that the gendarmerie was running a surveillance operation codenamed \\\" Othello \\\" against Dutroux in 1995 -- when both Julie and Melissa and An and Eefje were kidnapped .\",\"They show that the gendarmes were aware that Dutroux was building cells in some of his houses for holding children , yet this information was either not passed on to other police forces searching for the missing girls or was overlooked when it was .\",\"They also show that police investigating a theft visited Dutroux late last year at the house where Julie and Melissa were being held but accepted his word that the children 's cries they could hear came from neighbours .\",\"Justice Minister Stefaan De Clerck has admitted that mistakes were made and ordered an inquiry at the same time as stressing there were no indications of a cover-up .\",\"There is also widespread disbelief that no one appeared to question how Dutroux , an unemployed father of three with no visible means of support , managed to own six houses .\",\"Death toll of Algeria bomb put at seven-newspaper .\",\"PARIS 1996-08-24\",\"An Algerian newspaper on Saturday put at seven -- two women and five children -- the death toll of a bomb blast in a market west of Algiers on Friday .\",\"Algerian security forces said on Friday three women and two children were killed and five people wounded when a home-made bomb exploded at a market in the coastal town of Bou Haroun , 65 km ( 40 miles ) west of Algiers .\",\"The security forces also said a man carrying an explosive device also died after it went off prematurely .\",\"El-Watan paper said the blast killed seven -- a mother and her 25-year-old daughter , four young boys and a five-year-old girl .\",\"Several people were also wounded , it said .\",\"The explosion was the latest in series of bomb attacks in Algeria 's four-year-old civil strife .\",\"The government-appointed watchdog , Human Rights National Observatory , was quoted this month by local newspapers as saying about 1,400 civilians have died in bomb attacks blamed on Moslem rebels in the past two years .\",\"An estimated 50,000 Algerians and more than 110 foreigners have been killed in violence pitting Moslem rebels against government forces since early 1992 , when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead .\",\"Malta police seize cannabis among chilli sauce .\",\"VALLETTA 1996-08-24\",\"Police in Malta said on Saturday they had seized 7.5 tonnes of cannabis concealed in a shipment of chilli sauce on its way from Singapore to Romania .\",\"Police commissioner George Grech said the cannabis was found on Friday packed in 500 boxes hidden behind chilli sauce in a container that arrived at Malta Freeport a week ago .\",\"The container was on its way to Romania via the former Yugoslavia from Singapore and was the biggest drugs haul in Malta , police said .\",\"No street value was given for the cannabis .\",\"Czech coach in fatal crash in Austria .\",\"VIENNA 1996-08-24\",\"A Czech coach crashed and burst into flames on a southern Austrian motorway early on Saturday , killing one person and injuring 15 , police said .\",\"Austrian television said the coach , which was carrying 45 , was en route from the Czech Republic to Italy when the accident occurred near Steinberg , 200 km southwest of Vienna .\",\"Most Spaniards back talks with Basque rebels--poll .\",\"MADRID 1996-08-24\",\"Most Spaniards would support government talks with the illegal Basque separatist group ETA if the rebels renounced violence permanently , a survey published in daily El Mundo on Saturday said .\",\"While 57 percent of the population supported negotiations with ETA ( Basque Homeland and Freedom ) , 30 percent opposed it , the survey by the state-controlled Centre for Sociological Studies ( CIS ) found .\",\"But 80 percent said ETA had shown little interest in achieving peace in the Basque country when it offered a one-week truce in July while continuing to hold prison officer Jose Antonio Ortega Lara , kidnapped in January .\",\"The problem of terrorism had neither worsened nor improved since the conservative Popular Party ( PP ) came to power in May , according to 56 percent of those questioned , while 22 percent said it had worsened .\",\"The survey questioned 2,496 people between July 17 and 21 and has a margin of error of plus or minus two percent .\",\"Thirty killed as floods plunge Lahore into chaos .\",\"ISLAMABAD 1996-08-24\",\"At least 30 people have been killed and about 100 injured in the

knocking out power , water and telephone services , disrupting air and rail traffic , and sweeping away houses and cars .\",\"Newspapers quoted witnesses as saying they had seen bodies floating in the

homeless after a breach opened in the city canal , inundating residential areas .\",\"Army troops were called in to evacuate residents of low-lying areas to higher ground .\",\"Officials said the Ravi and Chenab rivers , which both flow through Punjab , were in high flood and emergency services backed by troops were on full alert .\",\"Internet Startup funded to develop Java software .\",\"MOUNTAIN

Botha could be among those called .\",\"But Currin , who is advising several people regarded as perpetrators , said this was not the best way to achieve the commission 's aims .\",\"\\\" A person can be forced to appear , but the only way one is going to get to the truth in its totality is if people feel it is a good idea to go to the amnesty committee .\",\"At the moment this is not the case . \\\"\",\"He cited Coetzee , who was charged with murder after confessing in media interviews to dirty tricks .\",\"His trial is due to start in December but the truth commission intends to decide on his amnesty application before that .\",\"Currin said the law had to be changed so all judicial prosecutions were automatically suspended for those who approached the truth commission .\",\"Last week 's submissions to the commission by the ANC , de Klerk 's National Party and the right-wing Freedom Front of General Constand Viljoen left many South Africans unsatisfied .\",\"Boraine said the picture was incomplete because officers of the apartheid-era security forces had yet to make their scheduled , separate submission , but one black caller to a radio talk show declared :\",\"\\\" This whole thing is utterly useless , it does n't help us at all .\",\"What the people expect is to have houses , to have jobs . \\\"\",\"Political scientist Jannie Gagiano said he doubted that the National Party , which implemented apartheid in 1948 and began dismantling it in 1990 , felt it carried a burden of guilt and needed to be exculpated through the commission .\",\"\\\" Therefore I have some doubts about achieving some form of reconciliation .\",\"One has to feel a bit guilty to feel the need for reconciling yourself to a historical adversary , \\\" he said .\",\"Professor Tom Lodge

.\",\"They said they were ready to force their way back across post-war ethnic lines to Serb-held Doboj , one of several towns where NATO troops fear violence involving refugees determined to vote where they once lived .\",\"The refugees , rallying in Matuzici on government territory two km from Doboj in northeast Bosnia , waved banners calling the polls a farce staged by the United Nations and the European Union . \\\"\",\"We demand to vote in Doboj , \\\" other banners said .\",\"Bosnia 's Moslem-led central government and many displaced Moslems are angered by a key provision of the Western-organised September 14 elections allowing people to vote in post-war \\\" new places of residence . \\\"\",\"As a result , separatist Serb authorities have packed former Moslem majority towns with refugees of their own or registered other Serbs to vote there .\",\"Critics say that what was billed as an electoral process to reintegrate Bosnia as a single , multi-ethnic state is shaping up as a referendum on partition , de facto or de jure .\",\"\\\" Only our physical presence in Doboj will mean that the Dayton peace treaty has truly been implemented , \\\" Edhem Efendija Camdzic , Doboj 's Islamic imam-in-exile , told the refugees .\",\"\\\" The main point of this rally is to highlight to the world powers what misfortune they brought upon us , \\\" said Reuf Mehemdagic , head of Doboj municipality-in-exile .\",\"\\\" Eleven thousand Serbs who came from elsewhere to Doboj will vote there .\",\"How can we then expect the reintegration of Bosnia ?\",\"But no one will stop us from returning to our homes . \\\"\",\"Mirhunisa Komarica , a government refugee official , said : \\\" We want to vote where we were thrown out from .\",\"This is a protest of warning and the next step is entering our town using all means possible , so let them shoot . \\\"\",\"Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic , a Moslem , told the refugees : \\\" We have a message for the Serbs who are now in our homes not to plan the future of their children there because there will be no good fortune in that . \\\"\",\"To loud applause , he added : \\\" We will enter Doboj , untie the Doboj knot and ensure free movement for all .\",\"We have to enter Doboj to free the Serbs from their own ( separatist ) politics . \\\"\",\"The Dayton peace accords guaranteed refugees the right to return to their homes and ensured freedom of movement across ethnic lines .\",\"But local police , controlled by nationalist parties in Moslem , Serb and Croat sectors of Bosnia , and civilian mobs have turned ceasefire lines into virtually impassable borders .\",\"The majority of refugees from Bosnia 's 1992-95 war are Moslems from the Serb-controlled north and east .\",\"NATO-led peace troops beefed up their presence in the Doboj area on Sunday to deter any sudden emotional attempt by the refugees to cross the Inter-Entity Boundary Line into Doboj .\",\"But the crowd dispersed without incident

Murray\",\"NEW YORK 1996-08-23\",\"Corporate America is planning major changes in employee compensation in the next few years , according to a recent study .\",\"What it comes down to is this : If you 're highly skilled , you 'll benefit nicely .\",\"But if you 're not and cannot contribute to your employer 's goals , you 'll be paid less .\",\"The survey , conducted in late 1995 and the early part of this year by management consulting firm Towers Perrin , showed that the focus will be on an employee 's overall value to the company 's bottom line -- rather than how well an employee performs a specific task .\",\"Presently , for example , if an accountant 's job involves doing five specific tasks , he or she can expect a certain salary , said Sandra O'Neal , a Towers Perrin principal .\",\"In the future , the accountant will be evaluated solely on \\\" knowledge , skill and abilities , \\\" she said .\",\"In addition to using accounting skills , the accountant will also have to be creative , work well in a team , be sensitive to customer needs and set productivity goals .\",\"\\\" The good news is , if you 're highly skilled and have many abilities , you 'll be paid more , \\\" said O'Neal .\",\"\\\" The bad news is , if you 're not skilled and ca n't contribute to a team , to customer service and the organisation 's goals , you 'll be paid less . \\\"\",\"Of the 750 mid-to-large size corporations surveyed , 81 percent had undergone a major restructuring in the last three years , and more than two-thirds reported that productivity and profits were up as result .\",\"Next on the agenda for these firms is developing a new compensation structure , and 78 percent report that they are considering a new , skills-based plan for both management and non-management employees .\",\"This coming shift , O'Neal said , \\\" is not just isolated or a fad .\",\"It 's an inexorable change . \\\"\",\"After World War II , corporations adopted a \\\" military model \\\" creating hierarchical organisations where \\\" the concept of defined tasks worked great , \\\" she said .\",\"But as the economy became global , customers were more demanding and problems became more complex .\",\"\\\" Multi-layers kept management at a distance from its customers , \\\" O'Neal said .\",\"Now organisations must change to stay competitive .\",\"O'Neal says firms will place a greater emphasis on teams and team performance in giving raises .\",\"If your team does well , you 'll do well .\",\"If it does n't do well , do n't expect a raise .\",\"Is this fair to an employee who can go the distance but is on a team that ca n't keep up ?\",\"\\\" That 's an important question we used to ask a lot , \\\" said O'Neal . \\\"\",\"It 's not a question we ask any more .\",\"The more important question is -- ' Do we have results ? '\",\"\\\"\",\"To get those results , 27 percent of the companies surveyed plan to eliminate base pay increases in favour of cash bonuses and incentives , such as employee and team award programmes and education .\",\"Companies that can change their culture and view employees as business partners will do well , O'Neal said .\",\"For example , the survey rated some participants in the survey as \\\" high-performing \\\" companies , based on their return on equity above 16 percent .\",\"Those companies also said they already offer employees variable pay and business education , give their managers more control over pay decisions and celebrate employee and team success .\",\"\\\" They respect employees more , they trust employees more and they value their employees more , \\\" O'Neal said .\",\"\\\" The key to success at high-performance companies is engaging employees in a business partnership .\",\"It will improve a company 's bottom line . \\\"\",\"Belgian police arrest

1996-08-26\",\"Four shiny new green-and-yellow John Deere combines parked at this 1,750-hectare ( 4,325-acre ) farm in the grain-growing regions south of Kiev do n't fill its chief agronomist with enthusiasm .\",\"\\\" They did a good job this year , but they need good diesel and good engine oil , \\\" said Ivan Odnosum . \\\"\",\"God help us if there is a breakdown , \\\" he said of the machinery , loaned to the farm after the Ukrainian government bought it earlier this year .\",\"The country 's grain harvest this year is forecast to fall by more than 23 percent to only 28 million tonnes and two harsh factors are to blame .\",\"A drought scoured the steppes in May and June , stunting the growing wheat .\",\"And the farming sector , making the painful transition from Soviet central planning to a market economy simply has no money .\",\"Ukraine 's black soil is so fertile that a diplomat described it as \\\" rich enough to grow rubber boots \\\" .\",\"But recently Ukraine has been losing its reputation as a breadbasket of Europe , earned in the years before brutal forced collectivisation under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin .\",\"\\\" The wheat will not be of a good quality this year , \\\" said Hryhory Borsuk , a scientist at the Mironivka Wheat Institute , run by the Ukrainian Academy of Agrarian Sciences .\",\"\\\" The temperature on the ground reached 62 decrees Celsius ( 143.60 Fahrenheit ) this summer .\",\"We 've never seen anything so bad , \\\" he said in an interview in his office , unlit since the government cut off electricity because of unpaid power bills .\",\"The harvest is gathered in the dry areas , but rainfall in Western Ukraine has delayed harvesting there .\",\"While Mironivka 's scientists , some unpaid for months , carry on developing new strains of wheat resistant to Ukraine 's extreme continental climate , Borsuk said the lack of cash in Ukraine 's agricultural sector is as bad as the drought .\",\"Collective farms and Ukraine 's nascent private farming sector have no money for fertiliser , no money for herbicides and pesticides , no money to repair old or buy new machinery , no money for fuel , and none to buy good seed .\",\"This year 's harvest is down from last year 's 36.5 million tonne harvest , which in turn compares with 50 million tonnes in 1990 , the year before independence .\",\"The decline is all the worse for people who recall wasteful Soviet times , when the Kremlin imported grain but priced bread so cheaply that people bought it to feed their pigs .\",\"\\\" Agriculture is very expensive , and there are no solutions to our problems on the horizon , \\\" said Odnosum .\",\"He said his farm , its 260 workers now readying the fields for winter wheat sowing , expected the land to yield 5.2 tonnes per hectare ( 2.5 acres ) but ended up with 3.9 tonnes -- still better than the national average of 2.11 tonnes per hectare this year .\",\"\\\" We did not have money for fertiliser , we 're in debt for fuel , and we 're borrowing diesel , \\\" Odnosum said .\",\"A few kilometres ( miles ) down the two-lane road which passes Odnosum 's farm , where the occasional horse-drawn buggy passes by , is the 1,700-hectare ( 4,200-acre ) Shevchenko collective farm , built next to a village still neat and tidy despite post-Soviet decay .\",\"Chief Accountant Natalya Sypron said the collective is strapped for cash , earlier this year bartering 220 tonnes of grain for diesel to fuel six rickety grain combines and tractors badly in need of repairs and basic maintenance .\",\"The average family earns 160-200 million karbovanets a year ( $ 800 - $ 1,000 ) -- but many have not been paid in months , Soprun said . \\\"\",\"People are working out of their own dedication . \\\"\",\"Borsuk said the farm sector has two options : \\\" We can sit down and cry , or we can do something . \\\"\",\"He said the government plans to increase the sowing of the winter wheat which will be harvested next year .\",\"Planted in late summer and early autumn , the grain is Ukraine 's largest export item and traditionally grows better than summer wheat in Ukraine 's soil .\",\"Further plans , he said , called for full provision of resources like fertiliser and herbicides for 25 percent of Ukraine 's arable land next year , for 50 percent in 1998 and 100 percent of the land in 1999 .\",\"\\\" If we follow this we 'll be able to sell 10 million tonnes of grain by the year 2000 , \\\" Borkus said .\",\"The government has been trying to phase out huge subsidies to the farm sector , and in a move back to pre-Soviet days has given up to 50 hectares ( 124 acres ) of land to some 36,000 private farmers willing to go it alone .\",\"Collective farms will last for the next few years , because most private farms now only produce enough to feed themselves with maybe a little extra to sell , said one private farmer : \\\" In the future , maybe , but it 's better not to hurry .\",\"\\\" Collectivisation brought us a lot of pain .\",\"And it went too fast .\",\"Privatising too quickly can also have a negative outcome . \\\"\",\"Gencor swells profit despite setbacks .\",\"Melanie Cheary\",\"JOHANNESBURG 1996-08-26\",\"Gencor Ltd on Monday said it had swelled its year attributable profit and streamlined operations to strengthen it for the current financial year despite a variety of divisional setbacks .\",\"Announcing the group 's results for the year ended June 30 , chairman Brian Gilbertson said : \\\" Happily the strong improvement in financial performance is not an illusion arising from the recent weakness of the rand relative to the dollar . \\\"\",\"Gencor raised attributable earnings to 1,803 million rand from 1,003 million rand previously - in dollar terms an increase to $ 469 million from $ 279 million - and won despite the group 's Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd posting dismal results .\",\"\\\" Not everything has gone well .\",\"We 've had substantial production difficulties at a number of our operations .\",\"The most obvious one with the greatest effect on the corporation was at Impala where we had the furnace failure , \\\" Gilbertson said .\",\"Implats posted year attributable profit of 176 million rand from 281 million previously .\",\"Not only did the company lock in 3.92 rand per dollar in February / March , but it suffered output losses due to a furnace shutdown last August .\",\"The rand was last bid at 4.5350 against the dollar .\",\"Nor was Implats the only operation to fail output targets .\",\"Ingwe Coal Corporation Ltd was hit hard by heavy rains .\",\"It forfeited nearly one million tonnes of production to flooding at its mines in Mpumulanga province .\",\"But Gilbertson said the greatest gloom in the year came from the European Commission 's blocking of Implats ' proposed merger with Lonrho Plc 's platinum interests .\",\"\\\" The big disappointment for the year was the failure of the platinum merger .\",\"From Gencor 's perspective we are taking the position that it is not on , \\\" Gilbertson said .\",\"Looking ahead to the current financial year , he said that Gencor would boost earnings further .\",\"\\\" Gencor is well placed to take up the challenges of the future .\",\"The group is soundly structured and prudently financed and is blessed with an excellent portfolio of world-class businesses .\",\"I think we can look forward to further growth \\\" .\",\"Citing the disposal of Gencor 's stake in industrial holdings group Malbak Ltd for one billion rand among other smaller disposals , Gilbertson said Gencor had pruned its portfolio to concentrate on core assets .\",\"\\\" We 've tried to clean up our overall portfolio by disposing of non-core assets .\",\"The biggest of those was Malbak .\",\"Overall a very substantial pruning ...\",\"leaving Gencor clearly structured along commodity lines , \\\" Gilbertson said .\",\"He added that the group still had about 85 million rand after tax invested in various shares , which were market for disposal when required .\",\"Referring to Gencor 's increased 41.5 percent stake in Ingwe , Gilbertson said the group would wait for coal shares to be cheaper before considering snapping up more .\",\"\\\" I think we would have liked to have more of Ingwe but it 's the question of adding value .\",\"When we bought the shares we bought ...\",\"at quite a bit lower than the price is now ...\",\"maybe if we just wait another few years for the next downturn in coal . \\\"\",\"Finally , Gilbertson said a growing proportion of Gencor 's income was coming from offshore and unlisted investments .\",\"-- Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482-1003\",\"Advanced Medical buying IVAC Medical .\",\"SAN DIEGO

's election organisers will decide on Tuesday whether or not to postpone municipal elections scheduled as part of nationwide balloting , an OSCE spokeswoman said on Monday .\",\"Officials from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) are considering the postponement following allegations of serious irregularities in the registration of Serb refugees .\",\"International observers say the alleged irregularities could affect the outcome of voting for municipal assemblies .\",\"\\\" Tomorrow ...\",\"the Provisional Election Commission will consider the possible postponement of municipal elections only ...\",\"the other elections will be held on September 14 , \\\" OSCE spokeswoman Agota Kuperman told reporters in Sarajevo .\",\"\\\" I think that it would be

..\",\". \\\"\",\"Kuperman added that options other than postponement were also on the table , but she refused to specify what they were .\",\"The Dayton peace agreement gave the OSCE a mandate to organise Bosnian elections .\",\"The Provisional Election Commission is OSCE 's top rule-making body for the poll .\",\"More than 600,000 refugees have registered to vote in 55 countries around the world , representing about 20 per cent of Bosnia 's total electorate .\",\"They are due to begin voting on Wednesday , August 28 , just one day after the PEC is supposed to make its decision .\",\"Balloting inside Bosnia is scheduled for September 14 , when citizens are slated to elect municipal and cantonal assemblies , separate Moslem-Croat and Serb parliaments , a national House of Representatives and a three-man Presidency .\",\"A Sarajevo daily newspaper , Dnevi Avaz , which is close to Bosnia 's Moslem nationalist SDA party , on Monday said the OSCE would postpone the municipal-level elections until the Spring of 1997 because of the refugee registration problems .\",\"SDA has a representative on the Provisional Election Commission .\",\"\\\" I do n't know what the source of the Dnevi Avaz report is , but it is consistent with what I have heard from western diplomats and from inside the OSCE , \\\" said an OSCE staff member in Sarajevo who asked not to be named .\",\"\\\" The word is that Frowick has decided to postpone municipal elections but that he will wait for one more session of the PEC on Tuesday to take everyone 's temperature on the issue . \\\"\",\"Ambassador Robert Frowick , an American , heads the OSCE mission in Bosnia .\",\"OSCE and independent monitors allege that Serb authorities have systematically discouraged refugees from registering to cast a ballot in the places they lived before the war .\",\"Instead , the refugees were said to have been directed by their authorities to vote from strategic towns which had Moslem majorities before the 43-month Bosnian war , but which are now underpopulated as a result of \\\" ethnic cleansing \\\" .\",\"Diplomats explain the purpose of this electoral engineering is to secure Serb control over pivotal towns inside the 49 per cent of Bosnia known as the Serb republic , consolidating through the ballot box what was initially taken in war .\",\"The top U.N. refugee official in the Balkans highlighted the voter registration problem on Monday .\",\"\\\" Results of the registration for September elections herald a dismal future for multi-ethnicity in Bosia-Hercegovina ,

Democrats ' first night .\",\"CHICAGO 1996-08-26\",\"The highlights of the first day of the Democratic convention on Monday were expected to feature a mix of party leaders and people who have overcome adversity .\",\"Among the latter were gun control advocate Sarah Brady and actor Christopher Reeve and the politicians included Rep .\",\"Richard Gephardt and Sen .\",\"Thomas Daschle .\",\"Here are thumbnail profiles of the convention 's key Monday speakers .\",\"Sarah Brady -- The nation 's toughest gun control law is named after Ronald Reagan 's press secretary James Brady but it was his wife who was the major force behind its passage .\",\"As head of Handgun Control Inc. , Sarah Brady , 54 , campaigned nonstop for tough gun control in the years following the shooting of her husband and then President Reagan in 1981 .\",\"Her reward was the passage in 1993 of the \\\" Brady Bill \\\" which requires a mandatory five-day waiting period for purchase of handguns and also mandates background checks for would-be gun purchasers .\",\"Reagan recovered fully from his wounds but Brady , who was close to death after being shot by John Hinckley Jr .\",\", suffered serious brain damage .\",\"Sarah was Brady 's second wife and they have a son , James Scott Brady Jr .\",\"Before the assassination attempt , she had worked for Republican congressmen and for the Republican Party .\",\"Christopher Reeve -- Reeve was best known for playing the comic book hero Superman in four movies but his greatest heroics came in real life .\",\"Reeve , an accomplished rider who owned several horses , suffered multiple injuries including two shattered neck vertebrae when he was thrown from his horse at an equestrian event in Culpepper , Virginia , on May 27 , 1995 .\",\"Almost entirely paralyzed , Reeve underwent extensive surgery to fuse the vertebrae to the base of the skull and prevent any further damage to his spine .\",\"That allowed him to be moved to a semi-upright position .\",\"Over time he regained the power of speech , so much so that he was asked to address the opening night of the Democratic National Convention .\",\"Reeve , 43 , was classically trained as an actor but became the prototypical handsome leading man .\",\"He performed in summer stock and soap operas before being plucked as an almost unknown to play the lead in \\\" Superman \\\" and three sequels .\",\"Richard Gephardt -- Gephardt , House Democratic leader , is a politician with a \\\" Mr Clean \\\" reputation who sought the presidency eight years ago and is widely believed to still have ambitions for the job .\",\"Gephardt , 55 , the son of a milkman from a working class district of St. Louis , is a consummate congressional insider , sufficiently skilled in compromise and the ways of the legislature to manage the often-unruly House Democrats .\",\"A former lawyer , he was in the front line of President Bill Clinton 's battle with the Republican-led Congress over the budget but has opposed the president 's decision to sign the Republican-written welfare reform bill .\",\"He advocated tough action against foreign countries to cut U.S. trade deficits but sometimes been out of step with the party 's liberal wing .\",\"He was an opponent of abortion until 1986 and voted for President Ronald Reagan 's big tax cut bill .\",\"Gephardt , a red-haired square-jawed man , is a less than fiery orator .\",\"His 1988 bid for the Democratic nomination only took off after he recreated himself as a firebreathing reformer of the establishment , standing up for blue collar workers and

a Democratic winner in a Republican state able to unite Senate factions .\",\"Concern that he might be steamrollered by the vastly more experienced Republican leader Bob Dole was dispelled when he showed a tough edge , outmaneuvering Dole in a wrangle over scrapping a gas tax and raising the federal minimum wage .\",\"In his early Senate years he was seen as a \\\" prairie populist \\\" , working on legislation protecting farmers ' prices and also on compensating veterans sickened by Agent Orange defoliant spraying in the Vietnam War .\",\"Daschle was a key player in President Bill

end mixed but London recovers .\",\"Leonard Santorelli\",\"LONDON 1996-08-27\",\"European bourses closed mixed on Tuesday with London clawing back most of the day 's losses despite an unsteady start on wall Street , hit by inflation worries .\",\"The dollar weakened during the day with many dealers sidelined because of uncertainty over Tokyo 's monetary direction ahead of the important Japanese Tankan economic survey out on Wednesday .\",\"But it recovered at the close of trade .\",\"Stocks in London started the week badly after a three-day weekend , slipping 0.3 percent , but bargain-hunters later moved in and the FTSE index recovered most of the lost ground to end only just in negative ground .\",\"Tuesday 's patchy showing in London followed a string of records last week , culminating in Friday 's trading high of 3,911 , fuelled by a wave of European interest rate cuts .\",\"The London bourse drew little help from the unsettled morning on Wall Street , which slipped in and out of positive ground after a stronger-than-expected August consumer confidence report refuelled inflation fears , pulling U.S. Treasuries back from their early peaks .\",\"Shortly after the report appeared showing the confidence index rising to 109.4 in August from a revised 107.0 in July , Wall Street relinquished virtually all its morning gains .\",\"\\\" Treasuries remain very sensitive to any indication of a strong economy and we 're still in that summer doldrum period of light trading , \\\" said Alan Ackerman , market strategist at Fahnestock & Co . \\\"\",\"Consequently , stocks and bonds are both subject to rapid swings . \\\"\",\"Frankfurt was the one bright spot in Europe .\",\"Floor trading ended up 0.25 percent and the computerised IBIS index climbed nearly 0.4 percent , given a push by the performance of chemical shares . \\\"\",\"The market is trading 100 percent on fundamentals at the moment as interest rate fantasy disappears -- it 's all company news , \\\" said one trader .\",\"French shares ended slightly down amid growing unease about a difficult autumn for the government which also weighed on the franc , dealers said .\",\"Bond prices were weaker and the franc was quoted at 3.4210 per mark for the first time since August 13 as worries about the government 's autumn budget and a weak U.S. currency lifted the mark and squeezed French investments .\",\"The dollar , which dropped sharply on Monday because of jitters over the Japanese Tankan survey , weakened further in quiet trading but regained losses to end the day close to Monday 's levels .\",\"\\\" Besides the Tankan , there 's nothing really until the U.S. jobs numbers next week , \\\" said a UK bank corporate dealer . \\\"\",\"There is still the summer malaise hanging over the market . \\\"\",\"Foreign exchange markets regard the Tankan report as an important indication of the country 's future monetary policy direction .\",\"If it points to weakness in the economy , the report will help the dollar regain some lost ground as speculation of a near-term rise in Japanese interest rates will evaporate .\",\"The Japanese discount rate is currently at a record low of 0.5 percent .\",\"The dollar was also pressured by the mark 's strength against European currencies amid renewed concerns over Europe 's economic and monetary union ( EMU ) timetable .\",\"CURRENCIES\",\"The dollar was at 1.4788 marks and 107.74 yen at the close of European trading compared with 1.4789 marks and 107.55 yen on Monday .\",\"STOCK MARKETS\",\"The Financial

six hijackers , who police said were armed with grenades and possibly other explosives , were believed to be Iraqi nationals .\",\"The hijackers started to release people for the Airbus plane in batches of 10 , starting with women and children , in what police described as a \\\" controlled release \\\" .\",\"Police said most of the passengers were Sudanese but that there were also an unknown number of Iraqis , Jordanians , Palestinians , Syrians and Saudis .\",\"Later they said the number of passengers released from the plane had reached 80 .\",\"FEATURE - \\\" Eco terrorists \\\" target UK builders .\",\"Edna Fernandes\",\"LONDON 1996-08-27\",\"Ecological warfare has broken out across the British construction industry , striking some of the biggest corporates as activists give up peaceful protests and seek to hit builders where it hurts -- their profit margins .\",\"Described by one British company as \\\" eco-terrorism \\\" , it is seen as the new business risk of the 1990s .\",\"Famous names like Tarmac Plc , Costain Group Plc and ARC , a unit of conglomerate Hanson Plc , have all been targeted .\",\"Activist groups are no longer seen by British firms as a harmless , badly organised ragbag of students and hippies .\",\"\\\" You only have to see them in action at protests , \\\" said David Harding , spokesman at ARC , Hanson 's aggregates company . \\\"\",\"They walk around with mobile phones and camera equipment , they communicate and gather support for demos via the Internet -- we 're talking about a highly sophisticated organisation . \\\"\",\"One road protestor under the codename Steady Eddie told construction journal \\\" Building \\\" earlier this year , \\\" If it comes down to full-scale economic warfare , we will aim to drive them out of business . \\\"\",\"As well as financial threats , companies also emphasise the \\\" terror \\\" tactics used .\",\"Costain 's contract to build the controversial Newbury bypass , which runs through a conservation area , has led to violent protests delaying building , bomb threats , staff intimidation and picketing of chief executive Alan Lovell 's home .\",\"A Costain spokesman told Reuters : \\\" We 've had all sorts of protests at the head office and the chief executive 's house .\",\"But it 's when it gets to the ( employee ) families -- that it goes across the line . \\\"\",\"Tactics used by some underground groups including the cryptic Berkshire Wood Elves , which distribute leaflets with instructions on home-made explosives , are now the subject of a police investigation .\",\"Other larger activist groups include Earth First , The Land is Ours , Alarm UK and Road Alert .\",\"The groups have targeted specific projects like the Newbury bypass and the M3 motorway through Twyford Down in the southern county of Hampshire .\",\"But they are also campaigning on broader issue such as stopping the government road building programme and out-of-town superstores which they say create more traffic , pollution and damage local communities .\",\"The government has slashed its road-building spending .\",\"Although protests may have contributed to the decision it has been seen primarily as economic rather than ecological .\",\"Graham Watts , chief executive of the Construction Industry Council , said : \\\" I do n't think many firms involved in tendering for sensitive projects realise the impact environmental activity has on the cost of running a project .\",\"\\\" But they are more alert than they were 3-4 years ago .\",\"There 's no doubt it 's a big issue now . \\\"\",\"He says the damage comes in two forms : \\\" Tangible -- in the form of extra costs , additional security , threats to staff and the more intangible damage caused by negative publicity . \\\"\",\"Watts said the cost of protesting can be heavy once the company is locked into a contract .\",\"\\\" I do often hear on the industry circuit of tales where the company tenders at low margins and the demonstrations which follow means they are running the project at a loss . \\\"\",\"ARC says it 's not just contractors in the front line but also suppliers like itself .\",\"Its own quarries came under attack after it emerged that it may be a supplier for the Newbury bypass .\",\"\\\" It was called the \\\" First Battle of the Newbury bypass ' , \\\" said ARC 's Harding .\",\"\\\" We had 300 Earth First protestors invade and occupy our site .\",\"Hundreds of thousands of pounds ( dollars ) of damage was done in one day .\",\"Plus there was the knock-on cost of lost production and extra security in future . \\\"\",\"Simon Brown , analyst at investement bank UBS , said this new phenomenon has led to a change in the way the industry evaluates project risk .\",\"\\\" When talking to Tarmac about the M3 link ( through Twyford Down ) they made it fairly clear that their risk assessment methods have been changed and now involve a very clear environmental risk analysis . \\\"\",\"Harding says others have done the same . \\\"\",\"As a result of eco-terrorism we are looking at controversial jobs more closely to see if the profit margins are wide enough to cover things like extra security . \\\"\",\"For an industry already suffering from razor-thin margins , overcapacity and stagnant demand , eco-terrorism is the latest bizarre twist in the construction sector 's tale of woe .\",\"London Carnival ends in high spirits .\",\"LONDON 1996-08-26\",\"London 's annual Notting Hill Carnival , the largest in Europe and second in the world only to Rio , ended peacefully on Monday with an estimated 800,000 revellers singing and dancing the day away in high spirits .\",\"Police said they made 30 arrests and there were two stabbings .\",\"But there was no repeat of the ugly scenes that used to scar the street festival , and police praised the crowds over the two days of festivities as good-natured .\",\"Around 400 police were wounded in riots in 1976 when the carnival , now in its 31st year , acquired its darker reputation from which it is now only slowly recovering .\",\"Shopkeepers still board up their windows and many residents leave town for the

's only run with a first-inning single as the San Francisco Giants claimed a 1-0 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Monday .\",\"VanLandingham ( 8-13 ) , who entered the game with one complete game in the first 56 starts of his career , limited the Phillies to two hits and two walks with four strikeouts .\",\"\\\" We 've been working all year on my follow-through , and I really concentrated on that , \\\" VanLandingham said . \\\"\",\"It gave me more life in all of my pitches , so the ball moved more . \\\"\",\"At Colorado , Andres Galarraga homered and drove in three runs as the Colorado Rockies had 10 extra-base hits and Billy Swift won his first game in almost a year in a 9-5 rain-shortened seven-inning victory over the Cincinnati Reds .\",\"Swift ( 1-0 ) , who made his first start since June 3rd and underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder earlier in the season , allowed five runs and six hits in five innings .\",\"In Houston , Andy Benes allowed two

walk and a triple by Brady Anderson to tie the game .\",\"Then Oakland manager Art Howe decided to intentionally walk Rafael Palmeiro and Bobby Bonilla to load the bases but Acre was nowhere near the plate to Ripken .\",\"The decisive pitch nearly hit Ripken and gave the Orioles a one-half game lead over the Chicago White Sox in the wild-card race .\",\"In Seattle , Jay Buhner 's eighth-inning single snapped a tie as the Seattle Mariners edged the New York Yankees 2-1 in the opener of a three-game series .\",\"New York starter Jimmy Key left the game in the first inning after Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez lined a shot off his left elbow .\",\"The Yankees have lost 12 of their last 19 games and their lead in the AL East over Baltimore fell to five games .\",\"At California , Tim Wakefield pitched a six-hitter for his third complete game of the season and Mo Vaughn and Troy O'Leary hit solo home runs in the second inning as the surging Boston Red Sox won their third straight

.\",\"Larry Fine\",\"NEW YORK 1996-08-26\",\"Michael Chang is playing in his 10th U.S. Open and enjoying his highest seeding ever , but the 24-year-old American had to overcome a case of the jitters Monday before winning his first-round match on opening day .\",\"Chang , seeded second behind defending champion Pete Sampras , took two hours 40 minutes to defeat 186th-ranked Jaime Oncins of Brazil 3-6 6-1 6-0 7-6 , 8-6 in the tiebreaker .\",\"\\\" I was pretty tight the whole match , \\\" conceded Chang , one of the hottest players on tour this summer with a 16-2 record on hardcourts that included two titles and a runner-up finish .\",\"\\\" Everyone has moments when they get tight .\",\"Hopefully , this will have been my nerves for the whole tournament . \\\"\",\"Joining Chang into the second round was Wimbledon runner-up MaliVai Washington , the 11th seed , who also needed four sets to get past talented Moroccan Karim Alami 6-4 2-6 7-6 ( 7-5 ) 6-1 .\",\"Washington 's win was not comfortable , either .\",\"The 27-year-old American hurried off the Stadium Court for treatment of an upset stomach after his two and a half hour struggle against Alami .\",\"\\\" Towards the end of my match my stomach felt like week-old sushi , \\\" said Washington . \\\"\",\"Maybe it was a combination of the heat and something I ate . \\\"\",\"Chang and Washington were the only men 's seeds in action on a day that saw two seeded women 's players fall .\",\"Australian Open runner-up Anke Huber of Germany , the sixth seed , was undone by an unlucky draw that put her against 17th ranked South African Amanda Coetzer in her opening match .\",\"Coetzer claimed revenge for the semifinal defeat she suffered to Huber in Melbourne by taking a 6-1 2-6 6-2 victory .\",\"Last year 's Wimbledon junior champion , Aleksandra Olsza of Poland , removed another seed from the draw by eliminating number 12 Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria 6-4 6-2 .\",\"Other men 's winners included a pair of former Grand Slam tournament champions whose victories set up a showdown in the second round .\",\"Germany 's Michael Stich , the 1991 Wimbledon champion , and two-time French Open winner Sergi Bruguera of Spain will face each other next after beating German Tommy Haas 6-3 1-6 6-1 7-5 , and Belgian Kris Goossens 6-2 6-0 7-6 ( 7-1 ) , respectively .\",\"Alex O'Brien , who scored his first professional title eight days ago in New Haven , advanced to the second round with a 6-4 1-6 6-4 6-3 win over Ecuador 's Nicolas Lapentti .\",\"Wimbledon bad boy Jeff Tarango caught a break Monday when he advanced after the retirement of German Alex Radulescu due to heat exhaustion .\",\"Tarango was leading 6-7 ( 5-7 ) 6-4 6-1 3-1 .\",\"Chang blamed breezy conditions for some of the erratic play in his match with Oncins , who had beaten him in the round of 32 at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics .\",\"Chang committed an untidy 53 unforced errors , though he made seven fewer than the Brazilian , who also walloped a woeful 24 double faults .\",\"The most deflating double fault came when Oncins was serving to force a fifth set , leading 6-4 in the tiebreaker .\",\"The set point came after confusion at the net on the point previous , which was awarded to Oncins after the two exchanged shots at close quarters at the net .\",\"First Chang approached the umpire , then Oncins , then Chang again before play finally resumed .\",\"\\\" Those little seconds were like an hour to me , \\\" said Oncins , who promptly fired two serves barely contained by the baseline as he frittered away his best chance .\",\"Chang ran off the next three points to close out the match but for Oncins , the contest was a personal victory .\",\"The 26-year-old Brazilian had risen into the top 30 in 1992 .\",\"The next year a close friend was struck by a stray bullet while riding home in a car from a soccer game in Sao Paulo .\",\"He died slumped against Oncins , who subsequently lost interest in tennis .\",\"\\\" Two months ago I started talking about quitting , \\\" said Oncins , who decided to give it one last try and made it through the Open qualifying tournament last weekend .\",\"\\\" I believe in my game again , \\\" he said .\",\"At the end of the day , a spate of withdrawals from the tournament were announced .\",\"Eighth seed Jim Courier withdrew because of a bruised right knee , and 1988 Open champion Mats Wilander bowed out due to a groin pull , organisers said .\",\"Women 's ninth seed Mary Joe Fernandez pulled out because of tendinitis in her right wrist .\",\"SOCCER - FRENCH FIRST

but both sides , struggling to find their form early in the season , were disappointing .\",\"Auxerre , who start their European Cup campaign next week against Ajax Amsterdam , dominated the match but were unable to score .\",\"Unbeaten in four matches , they still trail leaders Lens by one point .\",\"Lens , who have won all their three league matches so far , host Montpellier on Wednesday night .\",\"Despite another dismal performance , especially in defence , Marseille restored some pride by keeping the reigning champions at bay after losing 2-1 at home to Metz last Saturday .\",\"After two seasons in the second division and after taking on half a dozen new recruits this season , some of whom do not speak a word of French , Marseille are not playing with any fluidity .\",\"But German

Jean-Pierre Cyprien for his part in a post-match brawl .\",\"Cyprien , also fined 10,000 Swiss francs ( $ 8,400 ) , traded punches with St Gallen 's Brazilian player Claudio Moura after a match on Saturday .\",\"When officials and coaching staff tried to intervene , Cyprien launched a flying kick at Moura , but only succeeded in kneeing St Gallen coach Roger Hegi in the stomach .\",\"Moura , who appeared to have elbowed Cyprien in the final minutes of the 3-0 win by Neuchatel , was suspended for seven matches and fined 1,000 francs ( $ 840 ) by the Swiss league disciplinary committee .\",\"Club president Gilbert Facchinetti said he was astonished the committee had arrived at its decision so quickly and vowed the club would appeal .\",\"Neuchatel coach Gilbert Gress described the

release of six Roman Catholic missionaries , including three Australian nuns , held for nearly two weeks .\",\"George Garang , Nairobi spokesman for the Sudan People 's Liberation Army ( SPLA ) , said it was urgently trying to contact SPLA commander Nuour Marial at Mapourdit in the south to free the six .\",\"\\\" The movement is making arrangements for them to be set free .\",\"This is a decision of the leadership , \\\" Garang said .\",\"\\\" Commander Nuour Marial is a soldier so he must accept the leadership 's decision .\",\"But communications at this time of year are very difficult because of rains and a lack of power , \\\" he added .\",\"The Catholic Information Office in Nairobi said on Monday that four of the six had been charged by the SPLA with spying , spreading Islam and hindering recruitment into the rebel group .\",\"\\\" These charges are the interpretation of the church , \\\" Garang said on Tuesday . \\\"\",\"We have no idea why they are being held .\",\"We are still trying to establish contact with the local commander . \\\"\",\"Asked whether this meant the commander was out of control , Garang said the rebel movement was working on the problem .\",\"He said he believed all six were being held in the mission compound at Mapourdit and were reported to be in good health .\",\"The Catholic Information office in Nairobi said on Monday that Australian Sisters Moira Lynch , 73 , and Mary Batchelor , 68 , American Father Michael Barton , 48 , and Sudanese Father Raphael Riel , 48 , were held in a prison in south Sudan by the SPLA .\",\"It said Australian Sister Maureen Carey , 52 , and Italian Brother Raniero Iacomella , 28 , were held inside the compound .\",\"The church in Australia said on Monday Lynch , Batchelor , Barton and Riel were held in a prison until the weekend , when they were moved to join the other captives at the compound .\",\"The Catholic Information Office said the SPLA in the Kenyan capital had attributed the detentions of the six to a local commander and had promised they would be freed by August 23 .\",\"But the church learned in a recent meeting with the local commander that no instructions to release the prisoners were received and they would be held until investigations were completed .\",\"It said last Friday they were visited by Monsignor Caesar Mazzolari , apostolic administrator of the diocese of Rumbek in southern Sudan , and an SPLA administrator and appeared in good condition .\",\"\\\" On August 17 the mission was surrounded ( by the SPLA ) and sealed off .\",\"The evening of the same day the missionaries were put in prison or isolation .\",\"Later the mission was looted , \\\" it added .\",\"An Australian foreign ministry official said the charges against them were \\\" fairly bizarre \\\" and a matter for concern .\",\"He said Australian diplomats in Nairobi were working with the Roman Catholic church in southern Sudan and with U.S. and Italian diplomats in the

municipal assemblies would be postponed because of irregularities by the Serbs in registering voters .\",\"Ambassador Robert Frowick , representing the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , told reporters that municipal polls due on September 14 with other Bosnian elections would be put off .\",\"\\\" I have made a chairman 's decision that it is not feasible to hold municipal elections on September 14 , \\\" said Frowick .\",\"He said no exact date had been set but it was possible the local elections would take place in the spring of 1997 .\",\"According to OSCE officials , Serb authorities have pressed their refugees to register to vote in towns now under Serb control , but which used to have Moslem majorities .\",\"Human rights workers say authorities in Serbia and Bosnian Serb territory have conducted a well-organised campaign to coerce refugees into registering only on Serb territory and failed to inform them of their rights under the Dayton peace agreement .\",\"Diplomats say the effect of the electoral engineering would be to establish political control over districts they conquered and ethnically cleansed in war .\",\"The response of the Bosnian Serbs to the OSCE 's announcement was not immediately clear .\",\"But Bosnian Serb leaders have hinted they would boycott the poll if the municipal elections were postponed , or go ahead with their own .\",\"The Bosnian Serb cabinet , in a letter to the OSCE , said on Monday that any delay of local elections would be \\\" a direct and flagrant violation fo the Dayton agreement \\\" .\",\"The Serbs , who administer half of Bosnia in a Serb republic , said they had met all conditions for holding the September elections .\",\"Diplomats fear that the crisis could cast doubt over the entire election process , which already appears set to confirm Bosnia 's ethnic partition rather than its reintegration as the Dayton peace agreement had planned .\",\"New talks in Chechnya as Lebed waits for Yeltsin .\",\"Dmitry Kuznets\",\"NOVYE ATAGI , Russia 1996-08-27\",\"Russian and rebel military commanders finally met in Chechnya on Tuesday for delayed talks aimed at finalising a ceasefire arranged last week by President Boris Yeltsin 's envoy Alexander Lebed .\",\"The Russian army commander in the region , General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov , arrived at the rebel-held village of Novye Atagi , some 20 km ( 12 miles ) south of the Chechen capital Grozny for discussions with rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov .\",\"But Lebed himself , the Kremlin security chief , is still waiting back in Moscow to meet Yeltsin over his plans for a lasting political settlement in Chechnya .\",\"Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Kremlin press service as saying Yeltsin , who left for a state holiday home near Moscow on Monday , would hold no working meetings on Tuesday .\",\"Lebed interrupted talks with Chechnya 's separatists on a political deal on Sunday , saying he had to consult with Yeltsin .\",\"After a meeting failed to materialise on Monday , Lebed 's spokesman said he might meet the president on Tuesday .\",\"But Yeltsin 's spokesman rebuffed the suggestion , saying the president had left Moscow for a holiday near the capital .\",\"The Russians postponed the talks after a Chechen band disarmed a column of interior ministry troops on Sunday .\",\"The Chechens said a renegade group seized the weapons and said on Monday they had all been returned .\",\"The Russian command insisted that not all the weapons were the same as those taken .\",\"Tass said the weapons and the practical implementation of the ceasefire signed by Lebed and Maskhadov last Thursday would be on the agenda of today 's talks .\",\"Neither spoke to reporters before the meeting , which started around 10.45 a.m. ( 0645 GMT ) .\",\"Also in Novye Atagi on Tuesday morning , was Tim Guldimann , the Swiss diplomat who heads the Chechnya mission of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) .\",\"Guldimann , who helped broker an earlier truce in May , was not taking part in the Tikhomirov-Maskhadov talks .\",\"Lebed 's peace mission this month has stopped some of the worst fighting of the 20-month-old conflict .\",\"However , tension on the ground indicates that it could falter if the momentum for a settlement is not maintained .\",\"Three Russian servicemen were wounded in a total of six shooting incidents overnight , Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Russian military as saying on Tuesday morning .\",\"RIA news agency quoted an army source accusing rebel fighters of failing to turn up for joint Russian-Chechen police patrols in some districts of the capital Grozny on Tuesday .\",\"But the separatist command told Interfax news agency the patrols , part of the truce brokered by Lebed last week , would begin on Tuesday after delays for \\\" technical reasons \\\" .\",\"Yeltsin 's spokesman said he might meet officials during his break , but indicated Lebed was low on the list by saying Yeltsin would need time to study the proposals before talking to him .\",\"Russian news agencies also quoted the Kremlin spokesman as saying that Lebed 's representatives had not sought a meeting , hinting at an attempt by the president to put his popular and outspoken protege in his place with a lesson on protocol .\",\"Yeltsin , 65 , has kept a low profile since he was reelected in July , prompting new speculation that the two heart attacks he suffered last year and a rumoured drinking problem could be taking their toll , weakening his grip on affairs of state .\",\"Aides have dismissed such speculation , insisting that he simply needs a rest after his energetic election campaign .\",\"Some analysts say the Kremlin leader , whose order sending troops and tanks into Chechnya in 1994 started Russia 's ill-fated military campaign , could merely be reluctant to put his name to a peace process which might fall apart .\",\"But Lebed , who has no real power without his boss and has hinted at dark forces in Moscow working against him , appears to think a deal will not stick without strong backing from Yeltsin .\",\"His proposals have not been spelled out but are expected to involve a compromise between the separatists ' demand for independence and Moscow 's insistence that Chechnya remain part of the Russian Federation .\",\"Slovenia

's ruling coalition called on Tuesday for the impeachment of President Ion Iliescu for backing a friendship treaty with neighbouring Hungary .\",\"Iliescu 's Party of Social Democracy , the senior coalition partner , immediately dismissed the National Unity Party ( PUNR ) demand as crude electioneering .\",\"\\\" It is a desperate move by the PUNR , which is losing its only reason for existing ahead of the electoral campaign , \\\" said PDSR executive president Adrian Nastase .\",\"\\\" This treaty is both necessary and good , \\\" Nastase said , adding that the PUNR 's stance was threatening its position in the government .\",\"The treaty agreed unexpectedly two weeks ago will end years of disputes over the status of Romania 's large ethnic Hungarian minority .\",\"It will also boost both countries ' chances of admission to NATO and the European Union .\",\"\\\" If they ( the PUNR ) are so vexed , they could leave the government ...\",\"We might also help them to do it , if they go on like this , \\\" he said .\",\"The PUNR holds four key ministries -- justice , transport , agriculture and communications .\",\"PUNR leader Gheorghe Funar said in a statement Iliescu , in power since the fall of communism in 1989 , should be impeached for treason for compromising on the issue of ethnic Hungarian minority rights in the treaty due to be signed next month .\",\"Funar 's call came on the eve of the official launch of Iliescu 's campaign for a new term at November 3 polls .\",\"His appeal to the opposition to back his attempt to oust Iliescu was unlikely to succeed , analysts said .\",\"Iliescu has invited political leaders to a meeting on Thursday to discuss the final form of the pact which both Romanian and Hungarian nationalists oppose for different reasons

when neither of two candidates secured a majority in second-round voting .\",\"Incumbent president Lennart Meri won 49 votes compared to 34 won by his rival , deputy Parliamentary Speaker Arnold Ruutel .\",\"But Meri 's support was not enough for the 68 needed for election and a third secret ballot will take place later in the day ( 1300 GMT ) , parliamentary officials said .\",\"To win a clear mandate for the five-year presidential term , a candidate must secure 68 votes from the 101-member parliament .\",\"Enn Markvart , Chairman of the National Election Commission , said 96 members of parliament voted in the second round , with 12 abstentions and one ballot paper invalid .\",\"On Monday , in the first round of voting , Meri secured 45 votes and Ruutel 34 .\",\"Meri 's popularity has suffered in recent years , with politicians criticising him for taking too much power and acting without consulting parliament .\",\"If a third round of voting fails to give either candidate 68 votes , the parliamentary speaker has to convene an electoral college of all 101 MPs and 273 local government representatives for a new vote that could take up to a month .\",\"Slovak women visited

associate had told police of the scam .\",\"If not for the informant , the painted parrots ' true colours would not have been known for six months , he said .\",\"\\\" They moult in the summer , so

test ban treaty blocked by India last week , saying the pact would be an important step in achieving total nuclear disarmament .\",\"\\\" Although the final draft of the treaty probably did n't totally satisfy any country , it was in general balanced , \\\" the official People 's Daily newspaper said in a commentary .\",\"India blocked the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva , saying the pact did not contain a clause committing the five declared nuclear powers to a timetable for nuclear disarmament .\",\"New Delhi 's stance , which was seen as effectively thwarting 2-1/2 years of negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament , drew widespread but generally muted foreign criticism .\",\"India has also pledged to oppose any forwarding of the draft treaty to the United Nations General Assembly .\",\"China said many countries had compromised to complete the treaty and that the issue of a disarmament schedule could be discussed in future negotiations .\",\"\\\" The completion of the test ban treaty would be an important and practical step in the gradual process of achieving total nuclear disarmament , \\\" it said .\",\"China has pledged support for the pact since reaching a deal with the United States that made international inspections of nuclear sites more difficult than in earlier drafts of the accord .\",\"The newspaper said China advocated the complete ban and destruction of nuclear weapons but that there was little hope other nuclear powers would soon adopt the same stance .\",\"\\\" Some nuclear powers stubbornly uphold policies of nuclear deterrence based on first use of nuclear weapons , \\\" it said .\",\"China held on July 29 what it said would be its last nuclear test before a self-imposed moratorium that took effect the following day .\",\"China was the last declared nuclear power to announce a halt to testing .\",\"Japan declares food poisoning threat receding .\",\"TOKYO

spokesman as telling the cabinet .\",\"The O-157 colon bacillus has been found responsible for a widespread food poisoning epidemic that has killed 11 people and made over 9,500 ill this year .\",\"Sakai , near the regional commercial centre of Osaka , has been hit hardest by the deadly bacteria , with nearly 6,500 , mostly schoolchildren , affected by the disease .\",\"Two children in

, at least for Sakai .\",\"Sakai officials agreed with the assessment , but said it was too early to feel relieved .\",\"\\\" There are still patients hospitalised and problems which must be dealt with , \\\" a city spokesman said , citing the issue of whether to allow children infected with the bacteria but not showing symptoms to attend school from September .\",\"Health authorities believe school lunches were the source of the food poisoning in Sakai , but researchers have been unable to pinpoint the exact source of the infection .\",\"The outbreak has prompted authorities to tighten sanitary standards at slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants and sparked calls for an overhaul of the nation 's school lunch programme .\",\"The ministers agreed at Tuesday 's cabinet meeting to step up inspection measures for school lunches in September and October , when schools around the country resume .\",\"Japan 's Agriculture Ministry also announced that it will compile hygiene guidelines based on U.S. government methods of checking the safety of farm produce to prevent another outbreak of the epidemic .\",\"As of Monday , 31 children were still hospitalised in Sakai city , of whom six

Wednesday approved rules designed to give stock market investors a better chance at getting the best price available for their orders .\",\"The so-called order handling rules , which were proposed last September , were approved in a 4-0 vote .\",\"The new rules will require specialists at stock exchanges and market makers on Nasdaq to allow customers to view price quotes from other electronic trading systems that may not be readily available to them .\",\"The rules will also require that customer limit orders be displayed with prices better than those available in quotes publicly available at the time .\",\"Specialists and market makers are companies or individuals recognised as qualified to maintain an orderly market in a stock .\",\"In a limit order , investors specify the price at which they are willing to buy or sell , as opposed to a market order executed at prevailing prices .\",\"\\\" These rules are intended to empower all investors , by allowing their orders to compete on a level playing field , and by providing the disclosure they need to make informed decisions , \\\" said SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt .\",\"The SEC 's goal , he added , was to create \\\" one system where one price could be available to everybody . \\\"\",\"The director of the SEC 's division of market regulation , Richard Lindsey , said Wall Street firms will probably need to spend about $ 7 million to carry out the improvements called for by the new rules .\",\"In proposing the rules last year , the SEC noted that while technology has improved , commonplace practices still existed that worked against investors ' best interests .\",\"It noted that customers whose orders were not displayed lost the chance of getting the best possible price available in the market .\",\"It also cited the potential problem of a two-tiered market in which market makers quote one price to public investors while quoting better prices in private systems , thus robbing investors without access to \\\" hidden \\\" quotes the benefit of the best available prices .\",\"Earlier this month , the SEC settled charges of alleged malpractices on Nasdaq when the parent of the Nasdaq market , the National Association of Securities Dealers , agreed to spend $ 100 million over five years to upgrade its oversight of brokers ' trading practices .\",\"The SEC dropped a third proposal that would have allowed investors with market orders to trade at a better price if there were shifts in prices before their orders were executed .\",\"The agency said it would monitor effects of the two new rules before considering the \\\" price improvement \\\" proposal again .\",\"The agency also proposed rule changes that would require continuous \\\" bid \\\" and \\\" ask \\\" quotations from exchange specialists and market makers who trade more than 1 percent of a stock during any quarter on Nasdaq .\",\"The SEC 's limit order display rule will mean a major change for Nasdaq , where such orders have never been displayed .\",\"The president of the Nasdaq , Alfred Berkeley , was to hold a news conference Wednesday afternoon to elaborate on the new rules ' effects on the market , the second largest in the world .\",\"ITALIAN CABINET APPROVES TELEVISION DECREE .\",\"ROME 1996-08-28\",\"The Italian cabinet on Wednesday granted a reprieve for media mogul Silvio Berlusconi 's Mediaset

to expanding the company 's scope into pork production .\",\"\\\" Saskatchewan is well positioned to take advantage of growing world markets for pork , \\\" Saskatchewan Wheat Pool chief executive Don Loewen said in a company statement .\",\"SWP said it was analyzing potential partnerships with hog farmers and expected the first deal to be in place in 1997 .\",\"The end of Canada 's rail freight subsidy last year caused a shift in feed grain production to the eastern Prairie .\",\"Analysts said livestock production would likely shift to the eastern Prairie rather than feed grains being shipped to the western Prairie .\",\"SWP said it may develop pork production systems that provide farmers with large integrated units , and it may consider contracting programs between producers and packers which would operate within the existing hog market framework .\",\"Saskatchewan Pork International Marketing Group has an export monopoly but some Saskatchewan farmers earlier this month
